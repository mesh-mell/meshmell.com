# Meshmell Website Source

Welcome to the source code repository for [Meshmell.com](https://meshmell.com), an engaging and dynamic public project. We are open to contributions and excited to collaborate with the community!

## Participating

Interested in contributing? Fantastic! Hereâ€™s how you can get started:

1. Clone this Repository
2. change name `.emv.sample` in the root directory to `.env`
3. Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.emulators.yaml up` at root directory in the Terminal (*1)
4. Start a Local Server with `npm run dev` at `http://localhost:3000/`

*1 Currently, we are experiencing issues with the local Firebase emulator inside Docker, and we are actively working to resolve this problem. For more details, please visit our issue tracker. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. In the meantime, please start the Cloud Firebase Realtime Database app, upload the `./firebase_dev/realtime_database/emulators-app.json` file, and fill in each required values below at the `.env` file.

- `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID` to project id
- `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL` to client email
- `FIREBASE_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL` to database URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` to API key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` to auth domain
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` to database URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` to project id 
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` storage bucket
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` to messaging sender ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` to app ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` to measurement ID

## Construction

### 1. Firebase's Realtime DataBase
We are utilizing Firebase Realtime Database to store the following information:
- Category
- Models
- Models download count with timestamp
- Creators
- Sponsors
- Actions

For development purposes, we use the Firebase Emulator for Realtime Database, which runs in Docker. The setup is as follows: Realtime Database is accessible at `localhost:9000`, and the UI is available at `localhost:4000`.

After executing the command `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.emulators.yaml up`, you can access the Firebase emulator UI by navigating to localhost:4000. Here, you'll find seed (dummy) data located in `/firebase_dev/emulators-app.json`.

### 2. Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
We utilize Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for:
1. Downloading 3D model data via client web app.
2. Delivering images and displaying 3D models within the web application.

For development purposes, we are employing a GCS Emulator that runs on Docker and accessible at `localhost:4443`. We use Fake GCS to store the 3D data of the models.

### 3. Client App running on Google Cloud Run

For the client web application, the source code can be found in this repository.

For development purposes, the application runs on your local machine (accessible at localhost:3000). You can start the development mode by executing `npm run dev`.

## Tips

- ### `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_STATUS` Environment Variable
We have defined three settings for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_STATUS` environment variable to accommodate different stages of development and deployment:

1. `production`: This setting is for the production environment, utilizing Firebase and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) cloud services.
2. `development`: This setting is for the local development environment, using Firebase and GCS cloud services. Configuration of each cloud service is required individually.
3. `development_with_emulators`: This setting is for the local environment, using Firebase and GCS emulators.

- ### Running the Web (Next.js) App in Docker

If you wish to run the Next.js web app inside a Docker container, use the command `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.web.yaml up`.

<!-- - ### You can develop and test only use local environment! -->
